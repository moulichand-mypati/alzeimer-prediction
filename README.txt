README: Designing Neural Networks for Accurate Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Stages from MRI Scans

Overview:
This project focuses on the classification of Alzheimer's disease stages from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset includes MRI images categorized into four stages: NonDemented, VeryMildDemented, MildDemented, and ModerateDemented. The goal is to build and evaluate CNN models capable of distinguishing between these stages based on the visual features extracted from MRI scans.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the Augmented Alzheimer's MRI Dataset. It consists of MRI images from patients at various stages of Alzheimer's disease. The images are divided into four categories:

NonDemented: No signs of dementia
VeryMildDemented: Early stages of dementia
MildDemented: Moderate stage of dementia
ModerateDemented: Advanced stage of dementia
The images were preprocessed and resized to a consistent dimension of 75x75 pixels for input into the CNN models.

Model Architecture:
Several CNN architectures were built to classify the images:

Initial CNN Model: Comprising 3 convolutional blocks followed by fully connected layers.
Extended CNN Model: Adding more layers to improve model depth and performance.
Deeper CNN Models: A series of models with progressively increasing layers to capture more complex features.
Each CNN model includes:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction
MaxPooling layers for dimensionality reduction
BatchNormalization for stabilizing training
Fully connected layers for classification
Dropout layers to prevent overfitting

Training and Evaluation:
The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80% for training and 20% for testing). The models were trained for 20 epochs using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer. The performance was evaluated using training and validation accuracy metrics.

Results:
The models were trained successfully with varying depths. The results are visualized through training history plots for both accuracy and loss. The models show promise in classifying the stages of Alzheimer's disease.

Installation:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow (for deep learning models)
Keras (for neural network layers)
Scikit-image (for image processing)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)

Usage:
Clone this repository, install the dependencies, and run the provided Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the CNN models for Alzheimerâ€™s disease classification.
